# List of Common Knowledege about Kaldi

## Use Kaldi Binaries
1. In order to run Kaldi binaries as a command, cd to the example folder and run the following command: which means specify the sources
```bash
. ./path.sh 
```


## Kaldi Keywords

### L.fst: The Phonetic Dictionary FST
L maps monophone sequences to words.

The file L.fst is the Finite State Transducer form of the lexicon with phone symbols on the input and word symbols on the output.

### G.fst: The Language Model FST
### HCLG.fst: final graph

## File formats in Kaldi

scp: kaldi script file
ark: archive file
oov: out of vocabulary

Kaldi is a WFST-based speech recognizer â€“ it builds four different WFST/WFSAs:
H: maps multiple HMM states (a.k.a. transition-ids in Kaldi-speak) to contextdependent
triphones
C: maps triphone sequences to monophones
L: maps monophone sequences to words
G: FSA grammar (can be built from an n-gram grammar).

## Kaldi WER (%) Scoring
### How Kaldi Compute Word Error Rate

In the following file:
```
~/kaldi/src/bin/computer-wer.cc
```

#### Compute WER by comparing different transcriptions:
Takes two transcription files, in integer or text format, and outputs overall WER statistics to standard output.

#### Usage: compute-wer [options] <ref-rspecifier> <hyp-rspecifier>
E.g.: compute-wer --text --mode=present ark:data/train/text ark:hyp_text
What we need to provide is the hyp-rspecifier that can be used to compare with kaldi's reference file

file data/train/text is in the following format
