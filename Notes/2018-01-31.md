# Procedures of Kaldi Data Processing

## Kaldi data preparations

Write a python script to prepare the data that kaldi utility cannot generate for you.
In my case, I prepare the following data:
* audio data: a list of long audio data in .wav format store in the same directory
* csv data: the annotation source file where utt_id, utterance, start_time, end_time can be extracted


### Procedures

* Prepare long audio file
* Prepare python data processing script
* Prepare Kaldi directory

The directories and data preparation process follows the guideline from [Eleanor Chodroff](https://www.eleanorchodroff.com/tutorial/kaldi/kaldi-training.html) and the [Kaldi official data preparation document](http://kaldi-asr.org/doc/data_prep.html).

Before Acoustic Model Training:

In my case, I am analyzing children's audios, so I created a directory called "child".
1. Run the prepared python script [process_audio_and_text.py]()
In ~/kaldi/egs/child/ directory 
2. After the required filds are generated
We can use Kaldi's utility to generate *spk2utt* file. (This file is specified in Kaldi's official guide to not require manual creation).

```
utils/utt2spk_to_spk2utt.pl data/train/utt2spk > data/train/spk2utt
```

3. Validate the correctness of my data

```
utils/validate_data_dir.sh data/train
```

#### Special Notes
1. It is preferred to use "-" (dash) instead of underscore to name your file

2. the utt-id should contain a prefix of speaker_id
For example, *speaker_id-utt_id*
