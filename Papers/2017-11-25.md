# Child Automatic Speech Recognition for US English: Child Interaction with Living-Room-Electronic-Devices


## Summary
### Their contribution
* LRED data has an improvement of WER of 27.2% on recognize children's speech.

### Their Method
* Adapt acoustic models and language model from adult ASR to children ASR
* Vocal Tract Length Normalization (VTLN) 
F0: The fundamental formant frequency -> reflects the changes in the length and volume of a vocal cord
F1: The first formant frequency-> vertical height (high or low) of the tongue
F2: horizontal position (forward and backward) of the tongue
F3: 
F1 and F2 play key roles in identifying vowels and voiced consonants, while F3 is important is determining the phonemic quality.

### Strengths
Children's vocal tract length is smaller than adults and also differ in shape and sturcture to adults.

### Weakness

### My Reflections


Challenges of Children Automatic Speech Recognition

Children Age Group:
children of age range 5 to 12 years old

VTLN: Vocal Tract Length Normalization
MLLR: Maximum Likeihood Linear Regression
CMLLR: Constrained Maximum Likeihood Linear Regression
Potamianos, Narayanan and Lee: frequency warping, spectral shaping


# Child Speech Recognition in Human-Robot Interaction: Evaluations and Recommendations
(2017)

This paper evaluate four ASR engines, namely, Google, Bing, Sphinx, Nuance's accuracy in recognizing children's speech. 

## Contribution
Recommend best practises for children-robot interaction design, from the perspective of speech recognition.


## Gap
* A lack of corpora for children's speech, leading to *a lack of training data* and *a lack of benchmarking* for children's speech recognition models
* Children's ASR are fundamentally different from adult ASR
* Differences between children's speech and adults' speech:
    * higher pitched voice
    * disfluencies
    * ungrammatical
* More complicity: the ongoing development of the vocal apparatus and language performance in children: 
* an ASR engine trained for one age group is unlikely to perform well for another age group.

## Existing Approaches to solve this problem
* Adapt adult ASR to child ASR by Vocal Tract Length Normalization (VTLN)
*
